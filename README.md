### Hi there! 👋

I'm a full-stack Node.js/JavaScript developer specializing in Next.js, React, React Native, and PostgreSQL. With a passion for building seamless and scalable web and mobile applications, I aim to create digital solutions that enhance user experiences.

📱 Currently, I work as a Mobile Application Engineer at Gig Boss, where I'm dedicated to developing robust mobile solutions for the music management industry. I'm also a Junior PHP/Vue.js Engineer at Blink Web Services, where I contribute to a wide range of projects, enhancing my skills in dynamic web application development.

🔍 I thrive on the challenges that come with complex projects and am always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech landscape.

🌱 When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in the music scene or exploring the great outdoors.
